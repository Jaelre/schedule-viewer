# Idea
_One or two sentences â€” whatâ€™s the spark?_

# Motivation
_Why does this matter? What problem, pain point, or opportunity does it address?_

# Rough Shape
- [ ] DB
- [ ] API
- [ ] UI
- [ ] Other

(Tick boxes only if you *think* the idea touches these areas â€” no need to fill yet.)

# Priority
- [ ] Nice to have  
- [ ] Medium  
- [ ] High  

# Notes
_Anything else â€” links, sketches, half-baked thoughts. Can be messy._
