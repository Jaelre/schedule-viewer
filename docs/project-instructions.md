# Project Instructions

The detailed architectural guidance for the schedule viewer is now
captured as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Review the ADRs for the
rationale behind each core decision:

1. [ADR 0001 – Choose Next.js and TypeScript for the Schedule Viewer](adr/0001-foundation-platform.md)
2. [ADR 0002 – Store schedule content as Markdown-enhanced YAML](adr/0002-schedule-data-format.md)
3. [ADR 0003 – Normalize schedule times to UTC with localized display](adr/0003-timezone-handling.md)
4. [ADR 0004 – Deploy the schedule viewer with static exports on Vercel](adr/0004-deployment-hosting.md)

Future project decisions should be added as new ADRs within the `docs/adr`
directory so that the team can track the evolution of the architecture.
